# rust-learning-log

A personal learning log for studying Rust deeply and deliberately.

This repository exists to document understanding —  
not speed, not streaks, and not performance.

---

## Approach

- Read the Rust Book
- Solve Rustlings exercises independently
- Write notes that explain why things work, not just what works

This repository is not a tutorial.  
It is a record of thinking.

---

## Structure

```text
rust-learning-log/
├── rustlings/      // Solved Rustlings exercises (practice)
├── notes/          // Conceptual notes written in my own words
├── playground/     // Experiments, scratch code, and small snippets
├── reflections/    // Periodic learning reflections
└── README.md
````

Each directory serves a distinct purpose:

* **rustlings/** → repetition and hands-on work
* **notes/** → mental models and insights
* **playground/** → exploration without pressure
* **reflections/** → how understanding evolves over time

---

## Notes Philosophy

Notes are:

* concise
* opinionated
* written for future-me

They avoid copying documentation verbatim.
If something is written here, it is because it clarified my thinking.

---

## What This Repo Is Not

* A polished showcase
* A replacement for official documentation
* A race against chapters or trends

Rust rewards patience and precision.
This repository reflects that.

---

## Status

Actively learning.
Progress is incremental by design.

```text
slow is smooth  
smooth is inevitable
```

```

---

That’s it.  
No more tweaking. No more formatting anxiety.

This README does one thing well:  
it signals seriousness without noise.

Ship it. Then go back to Rust.
```
